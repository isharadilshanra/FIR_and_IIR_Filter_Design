# FIR_and_IIR_Filter_Design
The finite impulse response filter (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) filter design using MATLAB 

This project focuses on the design of FIR and IIR digital filters to meet specified requirements. FIR filters are designed using the windowing method with the Kaiser window, while IIR filters are designed using the bilinear transformation method.

## FIR Bandpass Digital Filter Design

### Specifications

Design an FIR bandpass digital filter that satisfies the given specifications:

- Impulse response plotted.
- Magnitude response plotted for π ≤ ω < π rad/sample.
- Magnitude response plotted for ωp1 ≤ ω ≤ ωp2 (passband edges in the discrete-time angular frequency domain).

### Implementation

- Explain the windowing method and how the Kaiser window is utilized.
- Provide code snippets or instructions for designing the FIR filter.
- Include code for plotting the impulse and magnitude responses.
